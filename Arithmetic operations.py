# simple python programe to understand the
arithmetic operations multiplication

#here, we storing the first input mumber in num1
num1=  input("Enter first number:")

#here, we storing the second input number in num2
num2= input("Enter second number:')
            
#here, we declaring a variable mul to store the result
#here we are using arithmetical operations to
            
multiply the two numbers 
Mul= float(num1)*float(num2)
#here, we printing the multiplicatin of the given two numbers
 
print(' The multiplication {0} and {1} is {2}' format(num1,num2,mul))
